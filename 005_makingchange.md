**Your quirky boss collects rare, old coins...**

They found out you're a programmer and asked you to solve something they've been wondering for a long time.

Write a function that, given:
1. an amount of money
2. a list of coin denominations
computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

**Example:** for `amount = 44 (44¢)` and `denominations = [1,2,3][1,2,3] (11¢, 22¢ and 33¢)`, your program would output 44—the number of ways to make 44¢ with those denominations:

- 1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
- 1¢, 1¢, 2¢
- 1¢, 3¢
- 2¢, 2¢
