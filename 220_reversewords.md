# Reverse Words
###### December 4 2018

You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

**Write a method reverse_words() that takes a message as a string and reverses the order of the words in place.**

For example:
```
message = "cake pound steal"

reverse_words(message)

puts message
# prints: "steal pound cake"
```

When writing your method, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
